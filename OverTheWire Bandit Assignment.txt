Congratulation !!!


SCRIPT USED 

level 22:

#!/bin/bash

myname=$(whoami)
mytarget=$(echo I am user $myname | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1)

echo "Copying passwordfile /etc/bandit_pass/$myname to /tmp/$mytarget"

Lets break down the script line by line

   1. The output of whoami command is getting saved in a variable called myname 
      (Since this script is being executed for bandit23 the output of whoami will be bandit23 which is saved in the myname variable)
   2.  Next the sentence “I am user bandit23” is passed to the md5sum command which will calculate the md5sum of the given string 
       and lastly using cut command the first field from the output of the md5sum command is selected and saved in the variable mytarget
   3. Then an file is being created in the /tmp directory with the name of the file being same as the value of “mytarget”
   4. And finally the password of bandit23 is being saved into that file

So looking at this script we can say that our goal is to find the value of “mytarget”. 
Since we know that the value of “myname” is bandit23 lets see if we can able to generate the value of “mytarget”.


level 23:

#!/bin/bash

myname=$(whoami)

cd /var/spool/$myname/foo || exit 1
echo "Executing and deleting all scripts in /var/spool/$myname/foo:"
for i in * .*;
do
    if [ "$i" != "." -a "$i" != ".." ];
    then
        echo "Handling $i"
        owner="$(stat --format "%U" ./$i)"
        if [ "${owner}" = "bandit23" ]; then
            timeout -s 9 60 ./$i
        fi
        rm -rf ./$i
    fi
done

Lets break down the script line by line:

    1. The output of whoami command is getting saved in a variable called myname (Since this script is being executed by bandit24 the output of whoami will be bandit24 which is saved in the myname variable)
    2. A folder called bandit24 exist in the /var/spool directory. The working directory is changed to this folder.
    3. Then a statement saying all the scripts that are present in the folder /var/spool/bandit24 is being deleted is printed.
    4. For loop is used to iterating through all the files in the directory (.* : All files in current working directory)
    5.A check is made to see if the current selected file is called . or .. if not then the rest of the code is executed. (“.” means current directory (bandit24) and “..” means the parent directory (spool))
    6. The name of the current selected file is printed and then the information about the owner of the file is saved in the variable “owner”.
    7. An check is made to check if the owner of the current selected file is “bandit23”. If it is then the current selected file is executed and sent the KILL signal after waiting for 60 seconds and then deleted (-s flag in timeout command is used to specify the signal to send to the command “9” is an alias for the KILL command)

So from this we understand that whatever file is saved in the folder “bandit24” gets executed and if the file was created by “bandit23” then after 60 seconds of execution the file is deleted. If we want the password for “bandit24” we need to write a script that will be executed from the bandit24 folder. The script that we write should get the password and save in a location that we can access (/tmp directory)

Lets make a folder in the /tmp directory and use that as the base location for all the operations here on out.


level 23 : 

#!/bin/bash

cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24 > /tmp/rand/password


level 24: 

#!/bin/bash

for pin in {0000..9999}; do
        echo "VAfGXJ1PBSsPSnvsjI8p759leLZ9GGar $pin";
done | nc localhost 30002

Lets bre down the script line by line 
    1. This is a for loop 
    2. The value returned by echo should be changed to the “password of bandit24” 
    3. Then we followvby the value of variable “pin” separated by a space as that's the format the input is expected by the daemon.
